MQL5 Example Code: Indicator and Expert Advisor (EA)
Introduction
This repository contains two main components:

Indicator: A custom indicator that assists in visualizing specific market data or conditions.
Expert Advisor (EA): An automated trading system that performs trades based on certain predefined rules.
The example code in this repository is designed for learning purposes, giving you a clear understanding of how to write and implement custom indicators and EAs in MQL5.

Contents
/Indicators/: Contains the MQL5 code for the custom indicator.
/Experts/: Contains the MQL5 code for the Expert Advisor (EA).
Prerequisites
To use this code, ensure you have the following:

MetaTrader 5 (MT5) installed.
A basic understanding of MQL5 scripting language.
Familiarity with technical indicators and automated trading concepts.
Indicator
File: CustomIndicator.mq5
This file demonstrates how to create a custom indicator that:

Calculates moving averages, RSI, or any desired technical indicator.
Visualizes this data on the chart with customizable styles and colors.
Can be applied to any timeframe and instrument.
How to use:

Copy the file to the MQL5/Indicators folder in your MetaTrader 5 directory.
Compile the script in MetaEditor.
Apply the indicator to a chart by navigating to the "Navigator" panel in MT5.
Features:

Customizable input parameters for various indicator settings.
Displays relevant data directly on the chart.
Expert Advisor (EA)
File: CustomEA.mq5
The EA is designed to automate trading decisions based on specific strategies. In this example, it:

Monitors market conditions through predefined rules.
Opens and closes trades automatically when certain conditions are met (e.g., crossover of moving averages, RSI threshold, etc.).
Includes risk management options, such as stop-loss and take-profit.
How to use:

Copy the file to the MQL5/Experts folder in your MetaTrader 5 directory.
Compile the script in MetaEditor.
Attach the EA to a chart through the "Navigator" panel in MT5.
Features:

Customizable input parameters for strategy settings.
Risk management features such as position sizing, stop-loss, and take-profit.
Dynamic decision-making based on market conditions.
How to Compile
To compile the code:

Open MetaEditor from MetaTrader 5.
Load the .mq5 files from their respective folders (Indicator or EA).
Click the "Compile" button or press F7.
Check for errors or warnings in the compilation output.
Customization
Both the indicator and EA are fully customizable. Feel free to:

Adjust input parameters (e.g., indicator periods, strategy thresholds).
Modify the trading logic in the EA to match your strategy.
Change the visual representation in the indicator to suit your preferences.
Notes
This code is intended for educational purposes and may require further optimization for real trading.
Always test any EA in a demo account before applying it to live trading.
